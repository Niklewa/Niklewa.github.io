This repo only function is to host my github.io page, which I am using as a business card. You won't find anything interesting here, unles you are interested in the background of my page and how does it work.     

In order to host your own page, read that: https://pages.github.com/    
To do that within R studio (that's how I did it), check out this tutorial: https://resources.github.com/github-and-rstudio/
