**Visit my website: https://niklewa.github.io**   
This repo only function is to host my github.io page, which I am using as a business card. You won't find anything interesting here, unles you are interested in the background of my page and you are eager to check out its internal contents.     

If you are interested in creating your own page, read that: https://pages.github.com/    
And to make it work within R studio (that's how I did it), check out this tutorial: https://resources.github.com/github-and-rstudio/
